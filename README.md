# Presentation for the Hypopo 

This is the GitHub repository for the files of my Hypopo presentation 'Creating presentations with Quarto'.
You can find the slides of the presentation [here.](https://carluna.github.io/hypopo-quarto/)

Some parts of the code are commented, so it's easier to understand some things I did but didn't show in the presentation. `index.qmd` is the file were the Quarto preamble is present and all the other chapters (from the folder `chapter/`) get included. 

> Comments in Quarto are embedded in `<!-- -->`. If you are using R-Studio or VS Code with the Quarto extension, they should be highlighted as comments.

If you use R-Studio to view the code, it can be helpful to use the `outline` function in the upper right corner of the editor. This makes it easy to switch between the different slides.
